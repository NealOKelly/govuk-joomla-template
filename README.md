## Disclaimer
I knocked this together primarily as a hobby project.  I also have an occassional professional need to mock up services in the GIV.UK patterns.  I happen to be comfortable working with Joomla - more out of familiariy than anything else.  

I haven't written code as part of my day job since 2001.  I therefore make no apology for the quality of the code - it is what it is.  If you want to make it better, be my guest!

I have no affiliation with the [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/).  If you choose to use this template please read (ad respect) the GDS [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk) on using the GOV.UK patterns.  In particular, services not on GOV.UK must not:
- identify themselves as being part of GOV.UK
- use the crown or GOV.UK logotype in the header
- use the GDS Transport typeface
- suggest that they are an official UK government website if they are not
